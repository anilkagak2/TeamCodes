TeamCodes
=========

Codes made during Practice Sessions.

Directions of Use:

1. Files to upload:
	* Please upload only the code files.
	* Delete all executables & I/O files before uploading.

2. File Naming Conventions:
	* Use the problem code exactly whenever possible (eg. On Codechef, SPOJ, UVa).
	* If no problem code is present, give a meaningful name; avoid simply numbered names.
	* Use Camel Case to name files.

3. Directory Naming Conventions:
	* All directory names must be prefixed with the number of the practice session in which the problems were done.
	* A meaningful name of the contest practiced must be given (say PlaceTypeYear).
	* Use Camel Case while nameing directories.

Hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
